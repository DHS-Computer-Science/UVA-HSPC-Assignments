# UVA HSPC Practice Assignments

## How to use git(hub) for the practice problems
1. accept assignment, click link
  - at this point a repo will be created
2. copy url of created repo
3. start the gui
4. [select "clone existing repository"](/screenshots/1.png?raw=true Screenshot 1)
5. [fill in the information](/screenshots/2.png?raw=true Screenshot 2)
  - Source: the url of the repo that you copied
  - Target: hit "browse" and choose where to save the repo
6. [hit "clone" to clone the repo and wait for it to finish](/screenshots/3.png?raw=true Screenshot 3)
  - the repository should be copied to the specified location
7. write code
  - open the Main.java file(the one cloned to you computer in the step above)
    - or create/open some other file in that directory
  - write some code
8. commit
  - [tell git to rescan the directory(**important**)](/screenshots/4.png?raw=true Screenshot 4)
  - [you should see Main.java and any other files you changed under "Unstaged Changes"](/screenshots/5.png?raw=true Screenshot 5)
  - [stage the changes 6](/screenshots/6.png?raw=true Screenshot 6)
  - [write a commit message(**required**) - a short description of what you changed/fixed/implemented/etc... and hit "commit"](/screenshots/7.png?raw=true Screenshot 7)
9. test
  - if works go to step 10
  - othewise go back to step 7
10. push changes to github
  - [hit "push"](/screenshots/8.png?raw=true Screenshot 8)
  - [and hit push again](/screenshots/9.png?raw=true Screenshot 9)
  - type in your username/password as needed

That's it. You have uploaded your changes. If you want, you can repeat steps 7-10 as many times as you want.

Step 1 needs to be done once per assignment. Steps 2-6 need to be done once per copy(although you should only need 1 copy).
